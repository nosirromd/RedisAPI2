# Redis as a Primary DB using a .NET 6 API

In this step by step video we ask the question whether we can use Redis (renowned for caching) as primary database. In order to answer that question we build a .NET 6 API with 3 endpoints, using Redis as the primary database. The video includes:

* An overview of Redis and its data types
* Setting up a Redis instance in Docker
* Using the redis-cli
* Step by step build of our API
